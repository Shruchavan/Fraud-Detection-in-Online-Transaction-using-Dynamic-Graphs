This project builds a fraud detection system utilizing dynamic graphs and a RandomForest machine learning model. The system identifies fraudulent transactions by extracting information from graph-based interactions between users, merchants, and transactions. The project utilizes Neo4j for graph building, and RandomForest from Scikit-learn for fraud classification.
